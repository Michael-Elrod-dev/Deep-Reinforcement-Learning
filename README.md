## Project 4: MARL-Drone-Pollination

### Overview
This project explores the application of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in automating the pollination process using drones. By simulating a dynamic environment where drones navigate and interact to pollinate plants, we study the potential for automation in agriculture and the effectiveness of MARL strategies in complex tasks.
