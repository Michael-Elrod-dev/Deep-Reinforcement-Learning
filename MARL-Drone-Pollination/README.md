# MARL-Drone-Pollination

## Introduction
This project aims to explore the application of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in automating the pollination process using drones. By simulating a dynamic environment where drones navigate and interact to pollinate plants, we can study the potential for automation in agriculture and the effectiveness of MARL strategies in complex tasks.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Framework**: PyTorch (assumed for ML models)
- **Simulation Environment**: Custom Minigrid Environment

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Michael-Elrod-dev/MARL-Drone-Pollination.git

2. Install the required dependencies (assuming Python and pip are already installed):
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To run the simulation, execute the `main.py` script:
python main.py
